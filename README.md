Learn to Program - University of Toronto
This repository contains my solutions for the introductory programming course at the University of Toronto. These assignments focus on building a solid foundation in Python, covering everything from basic arithmetic to complex matrix search algorithms.

Assignments Overview
A1: Time Calculation & Timezone Offset
Focus: Arithmetic operators and variable manipulation.

Description: Implemented logic for time conversion and timezone offsets, handling 24-hour clock cycles.

A2: DNA Processing & Validation
Focus: String manipulation, methods, and iteration.

Description: Developed functions to validate DNA sequences, calculate GC-content, and identify genetic subsequences.

A3: Word Search Game
Focus: Matrix logic (lists of lists), file I/O, and complex function architecture.

Key Feature: This word search game was developed entirely by me, including the core logic for finding words in various directions.
